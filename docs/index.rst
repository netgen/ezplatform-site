=================================

    introduction/index

**Site API** is a lightweight layer built on top of eZ Platform's **Repository API**. Its purpose
is to solve common use cases, remove boilerplate code and provide better **developer experience**
for building websites. While it will make **PHP developers** more productive, it will also lower the
entry barrier for newcomers and open most of the development process to **roles other than PHP
developer**.

With it, frontend developers, content builders and others will be able to do most of the work
related to eZ Platform content modelling, independently of PHP developers and without the need to
work with PHP. They will require only knowledge of eZ Platform's content model, Twig templates and
view configuration in YAML.

If you are new to Site API, read the :doc:`Introduction </introduction/index>` first.
